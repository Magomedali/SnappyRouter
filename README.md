SnappyRouter is a lightweight router written in PHP. The router offers features
standard in most other routers such as:

- Controller/Action based routes
- Rest-like routes with API versioning
- Pattern matching routes (based off [nikic/FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute))
- Direct file invokation (wrap paths to specific files through the router)

SnappyRouter makes it easy to write your own routing handler for any imaginable
custom routing scheme. It is designed to work with your existing "seasoned"
codebase to provide a common entry point for your code base.
