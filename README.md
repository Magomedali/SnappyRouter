SnappyRouter is a lightweight router written in PHP. The router offers features
standard in most other routers such as:
- Controller/Action based routes
- Rest-like routes with API versioning
- Pattern matching routes (based off [nikic/FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute))
- Direct file invokation (wrap paths to specific files through your router)

SnappyRouter makes it easy to write your own routing handler. It is designed to
work with your existing "seasoned" codebase and help with bringing code up to
modern standards while maintaining backwards compatibility and existing entry
points.
